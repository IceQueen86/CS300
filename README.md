What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The academic advisors in the computer science department at a fictional university called ABCU were working on developing a program to assist with student course advising. Their objective was to determine the most suitable data structure for storing course details and to display a list of available courses through the command line.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Begin by analyzing the task requirements and determining the application's intended use cases. Once those are clear, assess the features of each possible data structure and choose the one that best fits the application based on its advantages and disadvantages.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I ran into code related issues, I started by using a debugger and stepping through the code. If I was having issues, I would reference stack overflow or other search tools.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project enhanced my familiarity with the C++ development environment and deepened my knowledge of hash tables, binary search trees, and vectors.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project further advanced my ability to write reusable and maintainable code by keeping each function focused on a single task, including detailed comments, and striving to make the code highly readable.
